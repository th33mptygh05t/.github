> One engineer. Infinite agents.

We build **security tools**, **DevOps automation**, and **AI agents** — all in Rust, deployed on bare metal.

### What We Ship

**Gitty** — MCP server for Git & GitHub operations
**Cloudmind** — AWS management agent
**Forgemaster** — Infrastructure provisioning agent
**Netspectre** — Network traffic analyzer
**Spectre-Slack** — Slack communication agent
**Ghostdeck** — Unified dashboard with chat, reports & metrics
**Panam** — Jarvis-like orchestrator & personal organizer
**Bulwark** — Adaptive cybersecurity defense platform

### How We Work

Every repo has an `AGENTS.md`. Every workflow is agent-executable. All agents are built in Rust.
We don't reinvent the wheel — we wrap, extend, and orchestrate.

**Stack:** Rust · Next.js · TypeScript · k3s · Helm · PostgreSQL · Claude
